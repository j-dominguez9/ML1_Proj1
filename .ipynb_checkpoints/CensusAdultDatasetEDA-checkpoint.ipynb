    "## Purpose of Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was originally collected as part of the 1994 US Census. According to census.gov, The purpose of the Census is for the government to better understand the demographics of the people living there and where a variety of metrics are trending. This information is used to help determine where and how to allocate federal and state funding. The raw data was then extracted and compiled by Barry Becker and is available on UCI's machine learning repository here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two outcomes in mind with this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use logistic regression or a random forest model to predict whether an observation makes more or less than $50k$. Repeated 10 fold cross validation while be used to obtain metrics. While classification accuracy will be the primary measure of prediction success, since this is an unbalanced dataset, precision will also be an important metric to judge success to see how well the prediction works at correctly identifying those that make greater than $50k$. Since this is the smaller level of outcomes, it will be harder to predict, and in a context of trying to predict who to market something towards, could be more valuable. The goal will be to try to maximize precision while keeping accuracy above that of a naive models performance. \n",
    "1. To use logistic regression to predict marital status and understand how the other demographic variables in the dataset influence the odds of a specific status. Repeated 10 fold cross validation will be used to obtain metrics. Maximizing classification accuracy will be the most important goal for this model, because we are not interested in a single factor level more than any others.\n",
    "1. To use multiple linear regression to predict age. Repeated 10 fold cross validation will be used to obtain metrics and judging success based off RMSE, because it will provide a clearly interpretable measure of how close the model is able to typically predict the age of an observation from just the available variables in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**not sure below is good....feel like this class isn't like stats where we should/are supposed to care about interpretation much at all? and think log regression interactions are hard to interpret especially with lots of variables. also not sure which of the above 3 we want to try to do (think we need two)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these outcomes can provide useful insights into how demographics may interact to influence income. For example, it is reasonable to assume that occupation would have a clear impact on income, but how occupation interacts with other variables could provide interesting insights. Since this data is from 1994, it could also provide a useful opportunity for a follow up study with more recent census data to see how certain influences may have strengthened or weakened over time.\n"

    "* occupation (object with 14 levels): The type of work the indidividual does.\n",

Other methods considered were IQR and Z-Score based methods, however, since the numeric fields in this dataset are all heavily skewed toward a specific value (such as 40 hour work weeks or 0 capital gains), numerous realistic values are flagged by conventional measures. During the modeling effort, it could be worth investigating scaling these measures or turning them into factors, particularly with capital-gain, where the data suggests that any gains over 99,999 are all classified as a 99,999.
