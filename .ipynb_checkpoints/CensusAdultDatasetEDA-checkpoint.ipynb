    "## Purpose of Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was originally collected as part of the 1994 US Census. According to census.gov, The purpose of the Census is for the government to better understand the demographics of the people living there and where a variety of metrics are trending. This information is used to help determine where and how to allocate federal and state funding. The raw data was then extracted and compiled by Barry Becker and is available on UCI's machine learning repository here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two outcomes in mind with this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use logistic regression or a random forest model to predict whether an observation makes more or less than $50k$. Repeated 10 fold cross validation while be used to obtain metrics. While classification accuracy will be the primary measure of prediction success, since this is an unbalanced dataset, precision will also be an important metric to judge success to see how well the prediction works at correctly identifying those that make greater than $50k$. Since this is the smaller level of outcomes, it will be harder to predict, and in a context of trying to predict who to market something towards, could be more valuable. The goal will be to try to maximize precision while keeping accuracy above that of a naive models performance. \n",
    "1. To use logistic regression to predict marital status and understand how the other demographic variables in the dataset influence the odds of a specific status. Repeated 10 fold cross validation will be used to obtain metrics. Maximizing classification accuracy will be the most important goal for this model, because we are not interested in a single factor level more than any others.\n",
    "1. To use multiple linear regression to predict age. Repeated 10 fold cross validation will be used to obtain metrics and judging success based off RMSE, because it will provide a clearly interpretable measure of how close the model is able to typically predict the age of an observation from just the available variables in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**not sure below is good....feel like this class isn't like stats where we should/are supposed to care about interpretation much at all? and think log regression interactions are hard to interpret especially with lots of variables. also not sure which of the above 3 we want to try to do (think we need two)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these outcomes can provide useful insights into how demographics may interact to influence income. For example, it is reasonable to assume that occupation would have a clear impact on income, but how occupation interacts with other variables could provide interesting insights. Since this data is from 1994, it could also provide a useful opportunity for a follow up study with more recent census data to see how certain influences may have strengthened or weakened over time.\n"

    "* occupation (object with 14 levels): The type of work the indidividual does.\n",
    "* relationship (object with 6 levels): Relationship individual has with others in the househould, similar to marital status but includes other categories potentially more applicable to younger observations such as ownly child or not in a family. \n",

Other methods considered were IQR and Z-Score based methods, however, since the numeric fields in this dataset are all heavily skewed toward a specific value (such as 40 hour work weeks or 0 capital gains), numerous realistic values are flagged by conventional measures. During the modeling effort, it could be worth investigating scaling these measures or turning them into factors, particularly with capital-gain, where the data suggests that any gains over 99,999 are all classified as a 99,999.

    "Via domain knowledge, we suspect education to be a strong predictor for income; thus, it will be the first variable we will visualize.To avoid manipulating the dataset in a manner that may affect future models, we will run all visualizations through a copy of the dataset (df_2). For the first variable, Education, we made sure it was set as categorical, then releveled the factors, such that they are outlined from least to most vis-a-vis education level for easier interpretation. The histogram shows an unbalanced distribution, such that all levels don't have the same number of instances. When modeling, it will be prudent to create more pragmatic levels (e.g., \"< High school\", \"HS-college/trade\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Post-high school\") to address this concern."

    "Since Age is continous variable, there is no need to rearrange levels of factors, like we did for Education. A visual inspection of the histogram below suggests the distribution to have a right skew. There also seems to be an abnormally high occurrence of instances of age 36, specifically 1283 of them. A transformation may be beneficial for further statistical anaylses and modeling. The attribute ranges from 17 to 90, with a mean of 38.6. The boxplot allows a different perspective by which we can see the right-skew and the presence of outliers outside of the inter-quartile range (IQR)."

    "#### Race\n",
    "The variable, Race, adds a social component to this analysis and particularly for data from the US, a degree of complexity that can lead to higher precision and clarity. Like other categorical variables, we set it as such and ran a histogram with respect to probability rather than count, as in this case, it allows for easier interpretation of the data. Although we are not to expect a normal distribution from the levels of this variable--given that a random sample taken from the US population would not reflect this pattern--it is worth noting that the \"White\" factor is over-represented in this set per current U.S. Census Bureau data (76.3% actual vs. 86% set); this, naturally, would imply an under-representation of one or more of the other factors--namely, \"Black\"(13.4% actual vs. 9.4% set) and \"Asian-Pac-Islander\" (6.1% actual vs. 2.9% set)."

    "Similar to the variable above, Gender adds an insightful social dimension, whose analysis must be duly contextualized within the history of the US's social dynamics with respect to this variable and the nuances pertaining thereunto. Unlike the previous variable, however, there should be relatively equal distribution between the factors. In this dataset there is a considerable difference between \"Male\" and \"Female\" (67.5% M vs. 32.5% F); whereas, the current US Census Bureau data reflects a nearly equal distribution (49.2% M vs. 50.8% F). This disparity must be taken into consideration when making inferences or applying models to the general population outside of this dataset. Nothing in particular was done to this variable other than defining it as a category before plotting with respect to percentage of dataset."

    "#### Income\n",
    "Income is the response variable, so it is essential to be aware of the distribution found therein. In this case, we have a significantly unbalanced dataset with respect to income--this, unfortunately, may compromise the accuracy and utility of models derived from this dataset. There are methods to balance the data, however, that may be used prior to modeling, if found prudent to do so. Although this distribution may reflect the reality of income distribution in the US in 1994, a balanced distribution allows us to lower the No Information Rate, which makes the evaluative metrics of a model more valuable for prediction and classification purposes. We are treating this variable as discrete, despite Income being numeric in nature; thus, we defined it as such prior to plotting."
