    "## Purpose of Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was originally collected as part of the 1994 US Census. According to census.gov, The purpose of the Census is for the government to better understand the demographics of the people living there and where a variety of metrics are trending. This information is used to help determine where and how to allocate federal and state funding. The raw data was then extracted and compiled by Barry Becker and is available on UCI's machine learning repository here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two outcomes in mind with this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use logistic regression or a random forest model to predict whether an observation makes more or less than \\$50k. Repeated 10 fold cross validation will be used to obtain metrics. While classification accuracy will be the primary measure of prediction success, since this is an unbalanced dataset, precision will also be an important metric to judge success to see how well the prediction works at correctly identifying those that make greater than $50k. Since this is the smaller level of outcomes, it will be harder to predict, and in a context of trying to predict who to market something towards, could be more valuable. The goal will be to try to maximize precision while keeping accuracy above that of a naive models performance. \n",
    "1. To use multiple linear regression to predict age. Repeated 10 fold cross validation will be used to obtain metrics and judging success based off RMSE, because it will provide a clearly interpretable measure of how close the model is able to typically predict the age of an observation from just the available variables in the dataset.

Other methods considered were IQR and Z-Score based methods, however, since the numeric fields in this dataset are all heavily skewed toward a specific value (such as 40 hour work weeks or 0 capital gains), numerous realistic values are flagged by conventional measures. During the modeling effort, it could be worth investigating scaling these measures or turning them into factors, particularly with capital-gain, where the data suggests that any gains over 99,999 are all classified as a 99,999.

    "### Summary Statistics - Numeric\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution statistics such as quartiles, min and max, mean, and standard deviation are useful ways to explore numeric variables at a summary level. They help provide insight into what individual variables look like, providing a better starting point of necessary transformations or places where significant interactions may be more likely. \n",
    "\n",
    "The below is a summary of notable findings of the numeric variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Age - The summary statistics for age seem to show a fairly representative distribution of the adult working population (17 and older), however there is a slight right skew to the data with a max value of 90 but 75% of the observations being under the age of 48. This is the age we would want considering the main outcome we are interested in is income, people past retirement age, or under typical working age would not add any useful information to the data. \n",
    "* Capital Gains - Here again the statistics look to be representative of what we would expect out of the adult working population. At least 75% of the observations reported no capital gains, which makes \"domain knowledge\" sense. An important takeaway is the max of 99,999 suggests that there was a cutoff for the max value and that value truly represents 99,999 or greater. This will be important in later interpretations and modeling of the data, since it is not truly continuous.\n",
    "* Hours per Week - This variable had a bit more surpise than the previous two important variables looked at so far. The mean and median are right around 40 hours a week, which is expected since the data is collected from the US population. 50% of the observations are also between 40 and 45, which is also very reasonable. The minimum hour of 1 seems somewhat suspicious, however it could be they are reporting nothing but now \"passive\" income. The higher end of the values also seem questionable. 99 hours is a high amount of hours to be working consistently per week, but could be something like capital gains where past a certain value, numbers were bucketed together. Like capital gains, this variable could benefit from being transformed into a factor/categorical variable or otherwise normalized. "

    "* Native Country - As expected, the US makes up a large portion of the observations. Mexico makes up just under 2%, however, after that the portions are extremely small. This suggests it may be a good idea to bucket some of these native countries together to improve sample size, if they appear similarly behaved. \n",
    "* Work Class - This variable also is quite unbalanced, with private employment making up almost 75% of the observations, so grouping may also help improve model performance.\n",
    "* Occupation - The most balanced distribution seen yet, with no single occupation category making up more than 14% of the population. This balance indicates that this field may be one of the  most helpful in determining something like income, since there are less balance issues to worry about."

    "Via domain knowledge, we suspect education to be a strong predictor for income; thus, it will be the first variable we will visualize.To avoid manipulating the dataset in a manner that may affect future models, we will run all visualizations through a copy of the dataset (df_2). For the first variable, Education, we made sure it was set as categorical, then releveled the factors, such that they are outlined from least to most vis-a-vis education level for easier interpretation. The histogram shows an unbalanced distribution, such that all levels don't have the same number of instances. When modeling, it will be prudent to create more pragmatic levels (e.g., \"< High school\", \"HS-college/trade\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Post-high school\") to address this concern."

A visual inspection of the histogram below suggests the distribution to have a right skew. There also seems to be an abnormally high occurrence of instances of age 36, specifically 1283 of them. A transformation may be beneficial for further statistical anaylses and modeling. The attribute ranges from 17 to 90, with a mean of 38.6. The boxplot allows a different perspective by which we can see the right-skew and the presence of outliers outside of the inter-quartile range (IQR)."

    "#### Race\n",
    "The variable, Race, adds a social component to this analysis and particularly for data from the US, a degree of complexity that can lead to higher precision and clarity. Like other categorical variables, we set it as such and ran a histogram with respect to probability rather than count, as in this case, it allows for easier interpretation of the data. Although we are not to expect a normal distribution from the levels of this variable--given that a random sample taken from the US population would not reflect this pattern--it is worth noting that the \"White\" factor is over-represented in this set per current U.S. Census Bureau data (76.3% actual vs. 86% set); this, naturally, would imply an under-representation of one or more of the other factors--namely, \"Black\"(13.4% actual vs. 9.4% set) and \"Asian-Pac-Islander\" (6.1% actual vs. 2.9% set)."

    "Similar to the variable above, Gender adds an insightful social dimension, whose analysis must be duly contextualized within the history of the US's social dynamics with respect to this variable and the nuances pertaining thereunto. Unlike the previous variable, however, there should be relatively equal distribution between the factors. In this dataset there is a considerable difference between \"Male\" and \"Female\" (67.5% M vs. 32.5% F); whereas, the current US Census Bureau data reflects a nearly equal distribution (49.2% M vs. 50.8% F). This disparity must be taken into consideration when making inferences or applying models to the general population outside of this dataset. Nothing in particular was done to this variable other than defining it as a category before plotting with respect to percentage of dataset."

    "#### Income\n",
    "Income is the response variable, so it is essential to be aware of the distribution found therein. In this case, we have a significantly unbalanced dataset with respect to income--this, unfortunately, may compromise the accuracy and utility of models derived from this dataset. There are methods to balance the data, however, that may be used prior to modeling, if found prudent to do so. Although this distribution may reflect the reality of income distribution in the US in 1994, a balanced distribution allows us to lower the No Information Rate, which makes the evaluative metrics of a model more valuable for prediction and classification purposes. We are treating this variable as discrete, despite Income being numeric in nature; thus, we defined it as such prior to plotting."
