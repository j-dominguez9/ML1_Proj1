    "In checking for outliers, a preliminary visual inspection was used on the distributions of the numeric columns. Other methods considered were IQR and Z-Score based methods, however, since the numeric fields in this dataset are all heavily skewed toward a specific value (such as 40 hour work weeks or 0 capital gains), numerous realistic values are flagged by conventional measures. During the modeling effort, it could be worth investigating scaling these measures or turning them into factors, particularly with capital-gain, where the data suggests that any gains over 99,999 are all classified as a 99,999.

    "Via domain knowledge, we suspect education to be a strong predictor for income; thus, it will be the first variable we will visualize. To avoid manipulating the dataset in a manner that may affect future models, we will run all visualizations through a copy of the dataset (df_viz). For the first variable, Education, we made sure it was set as categorical, then releveled the factors, such that they are outlined from least to highest vis-a-vis education level for easier interpretation. The histogram shows an unbalanced distribution, such that all levels don't have the same number of instances. When modeling, it will be prudent to create more pragmatic levels (e.g., \"< High school\", \"HS-college/trade\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Post-high school\") to address this concern."

A visual inspection of the histogram below suggests the distribution to have a right skew. There also seems to be an abnormally high occurrence of instances of age 36, specifically 1283 of them. A transformation may be beneficial for further statistical anaylses and modeling. The attribute ranges from 17 to 90, with a mean of 38.6. The boxplot allows a different perspective by which we can see the right-skew and the presence of outliers outside of the inter-quartile range (IQR)."

    "#### Race\n",
    "The variable, Race, adds a social component to this analysis and particularly for data from the US, a degree of complexity that can lead to higher precision and clarity. Like other categorical variables, we set it as such and ran a histogram with respect to probability rather than count, as in this case, it allows for easier interpretation of the data. Although we are not to expect a normal distribution from the levels of this variable--given that a random sample taken from the US population would not reflect this pattern--it is worth noting that the \"White\" factor is over-represented in this set per current U.S. Census Bureau data (76.3% actual vs. 86% set); this, naturally, would imply an under-representation of one or more of the other factors--namely, \"Black\"(13.4% actual vs. 9.4% set) and \"Asian-Pac-Islander\" (6.1% actual vs. 2.9% set)."

    "Similar to the variable above, Gender adds an insightful social dimension, whose analysis must be duly contextualized within the history of the US's social dynamics with respect to this variable and the nuances pertaining thereunto. Unlike the previous variable, however, there should be relatively equal distribution between the factors. In this dataset there is a considerable difference between \"Male\" and \"Female\" (67.5% M vs. 32.5% F); whereas, the current US Census Bureau data reflects a nearly equal distribution (49.2% M vs. 50.8% F). This disparity must be taken into consideration when making inferences or applying models to the general population outside of this dataset. Nothing in particular was done to this variable other than defining it as a category before plotting with respect to percentage of dataset. A simple bar graph/histogram is effective at clearly providing the insights discussed above."

    "#### Income\n",
    "Income is one of the response variables being used, so it is essential to be aware of the distribution found therein. In this case, we have a significantly unbalanced dataset with respect to income--this, unfortunately, may compromise the accuracy and utility of models derived from this dataset. There are methods to balance the data, however, that may be used prior to modeling, if found prudent to do so. Although this distribution may reflect the reality of income distribution in the US in 1994, a balanced distribution allows us to lower the No Information Rate, which makes the evaluative metrics of a model more valuable for prediction and classification purposes. We are treating this variable as discrete, despite Income being numeric in nature; thus, we defined it as such prior to plotting. A simple bar graph/histogram is effective at clearly providing the insights discussed above."

    "Although the average number of hours don't seem to differ by much across these different categories, there are some clear differences in the range and variability of hours worked in these groups.  As we may expect, we see below that individuals that worked without pay were more likely to work fewer hours. We also see that self-employed individuals that work in corporate entities (Self-emp-inc) were on the upper end of the spectrum, working more hours. It is also interesting to see the wide distributions of those that were self-employed, as opposed to the much narrower distributions of those that worked in government. "
